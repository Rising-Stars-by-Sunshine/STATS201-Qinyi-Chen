#"Investigating the Brain's Response: Hyperalignment & Decoded Neurofeedback"
This study explores the enigmatic relationship between neural signals and consciousness. Leveraging hyperalignment, it deciphers how the brain represents motor patterns. Decoded Neurofeedback aids post-injury motor recovery. These methods enrich our understanding of neural representation and offer non-pharmacological solutions for psychological and neurological disorders, promising improved clinical outcomes.
